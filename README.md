# Project_R_HousePricing

The goal of this project is to investigate the features involved in the determination of the houses' prices and develop the best price modeling algorithm. I start it with a brief explanation about the data and next steps, head into the cleaning for further analysis in sequence, get first insights delivered by exploratory data analysis and steps of construction of a functional model.

# Instructions

The analysis was made using R, trought the RStudio plataform, using the main packages of the Tidyverse suite. Also worth mentioning the MLR library for machine learning analysis, along with other packages needed by this one such as XGBoost (check package documentation in GitHub).

# Guidelines

The work has 6 files: the scripts used to generate the objects with annotations relevant to the development and next steps, jointly with a Rmd structuring the report, this itself in html format.
